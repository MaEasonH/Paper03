"As society becomes increasingly influenced by the principles of political correctness, the prevalence of violence linked to racial tensions has garnered significant attention from both the public sphere and the academic community, highlighting the critical need for a thorough analysis to guide policy and training in law enforcement agencies. Amid rising demands for justice and transparency, the exploration of how police demographic characteristics (like gender and race) affect the frequency of force use incidents has become a pivotal area of study. This paper explores the intricate relationship between these demographic variables and the rate of reported force use incidents, seeking to uncover patterns that may explain such interactions. Despite a wealth of research on police conduct and methodologies, there remains a notable deficiency in empirical investigations that accurately measure the influence of police gender and race on the incidence of use-of-force occurrences."

The linear regression model summary provided statistical insights into the relationship between the incident count and the predictors, which include gender and perceived race of individuals involved in police interactions. The coefficients table indicated that several predictors were statistically significant, as evidenced by p-values less than 0.05. The residual statistics suggested that the model's predictions deviated from the actual counts by a certain amount, with a range from [minimum residual] to [maximum residual].The variable's impact on incident counts is statistically significant. In other words, the observed data is sufficient to convince us that, at a 95% confidence level, there is a non-zero association between the variable and incident counts.WHich means. Therefore, The frequency of use of force by police is significantly associated with their race and gender.The Multiple R-squared value is 0.2779, indicating that approximately 27.79% of the variability in the incident count can be explained by the model. However, this is quite low, suggesting that many factors influencing the incident count are not captured by the model.The Adjusted R-squared value is 0.2795, which is adjusted for the number of predictors in the model and can be negative if the model does not explain the variability in the data.The F-statistic is 1.112 with a p-value of 0.3891, suggesting that there is not enough evidence to conclude that the model significantly predicts the incident count.The provided model does not seem to have a strong predictive power as indicated by the low R-squared value and the non-significant F-statistic.The individual predictors (gender and perceived race categories) also do not show a statistically significant relationship with the incident count at the traditional 0.05 level.It might be necessary to review the model, consider adding other relevant variables, check for interaction effects, or explore other types of models that might better capture the relationship between the predictors and the response variable. which proves gender and human race do not have influence to the Incidents of use of force.

In conclusion, our study significantly contributes to the ongoing discourse on the use of force by police, highlighting the critical need for a nuanced understanding of how demographic factors such as gender and race influence these incidents. While our linear model reveals that simply correlating the frequency of force used with the gender and race of officers does not conclusively indicate a higher tendency for violence among specific demographic groups, it underscores the complexity of police use-of-force events and the limitations of using demographic data in isolation. The findings advocate for a more sophisticated approach to analyzing police behavior, suggesting that interventions and training programs must be informed by comprehensive empirical evidence that considers a wider range of variables. By moving beyond simplistic associations and delving into the intricate dynamics at play, our research paves the way for developing more effective strategies to address bias, enhance accountability, and foster a culture of trust and respect between law enforcement and the communities they serve. This work not only enriches the academic literature on policing but also has practical implications for policy-making and the implementation of reforms aimed at minimizing the use of force and improving the overall quality of police interactions with the public.
